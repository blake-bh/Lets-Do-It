    Our database only uses one table: the users table. The setup.sql file should create the table, once you create the "LDT" database. 

    We are using two APIs. ExerciseDB, which is a GET request with the paramter of a body part. Recipe and Ingredient API which is also a GET request with the parameter of a single ingredient on the grocery list page, and up to five ingredients on the recipe page. The response type is always JSON. These APIs come from rapidapi.com.
